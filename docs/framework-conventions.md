# Framework conventions (shared reference)

The architecture reference for this framework. The authoring skills
(`presentation-planner`, `deck-builder`, `slide-builder`, `artefact-builder`,
`skin-builder`) all read this file first; it is also the doc to read by hand when
you want the whole picture. For day-to-day "what tag / class / knob do I use", see
[`cheatsheet.md`](./cheatsheet.md); for the plan file, [`plan-format.md`](./plan-format.md).

## 1. Repo layout

```
index.html                     .reveal > .slides holds only `<!-- @slides -->`
                               plus one <style>@layer ...;</style> that pins layer order
deck.css                       ROOT-level deck look: brand knobs (commented menu) +
                               deck-wide element tweaks + utility classes.
                               @layer deck (highest). Edit per deck to re-skin.
deck.config.js                 ROOT-level Reveal knobs a deck author tunes: slide
                               size, transition, slideNumber, hash, and `chrome`
                               (a logo + footer on every slide). src/main.js spreads
                               the rest into new Reveal({...}) and mounts `chrome`
                               into .reveal; plugins stay in src.
build/vite-plugin-slides.js     stitches slides/*.{html,md} into that marker (dev + build)
vite.config.ts                  Reveal's config + `@ -> /src` alias + slides() plugin
vite.config.deck.js             `npm run build:deck` -> static export in deck-dist/

src/
  main.js                       single entry: styles -> registry -> Reveal(../deck.config.js + Notes,Markdown) -> gsap/alpine
  styles/
    layers.css                  the @layer order declaration
    index.css                   ordered @imports of everything below, incl. ../../deck.css last
    vendor/reveal-base.scss     wraps css/reset.css + css/layout.scss + css/reveal.scss
                                + css/theme/template/theme.scss into cascade layers (Sass compile time)
    vars/primitives.css         TIER 1 - raw values (@layer vars.primitive)
    vars/semantic.css           TIER 2 - role names + [data-theme] skins (@layer vars.semantic)
    theme/deck.css              maps semantic vars -> Reveal --r-* API (@layer theme). Plumbing only.
  components/                  FRAMEWORK MACHINERY (the contract) - NOT a deck's own components,
                               see components/ at repo root for those
    deck-element.js             DeckElement base class
    registry.js                 THE manifest + barrel - the one list of what components exist
    shared-styles.js            SHARED_STYLES - shared CSS vocabulary (.chip/.box/.btn/...),
                                imported (never copied) into every component's static styles
    README.md                   the component contract
  lib/

    d3.js                       d3 + topojson + readPalette(); imported lazily by components
    alpine.js                   initAlpine() - reactive UI + Alpine.store('deck') cross-slide state

slides/
  README.md                     slide portability contract + numbering
  NN[.M]-<slug>.{html,md}        one file per slide position

components/                    THIS DECK'S <deck-*> implementations (deck-author content,
                               same standing as slides/ and deck.css - not under src/)
  README.md                     what goes here vs. src/components/
  <kebab>/index.js              one component; the only customElements.define() site for it

public/
  served at the site root by Vite (default `publicDir` behaviour) - a file at
  `public/foo/bar.png` is fetched as `/foo/bar.png`, **never** `/public/foo/bar.png`.
  Images, video, and other static assets referenced from a slide live here.
```

Reveal.js 6.0.1 is the base (its `js/`, `css/`, `plugin/`, `dist/`, build scripts kept
intact). Upstream is the git remote `upstream`; framework updates come via
`git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/<tag>`.

---

## 2. CSS custom property tiers

**Tier 1 - primitives** (`src/styles/vars/primitives.css`, `@layer vars.primitive`):
raw context-free values - `--color-*`, `--size-*`, `--radius-*`, `--font-*`,
`--dur-*`, `--ease-*`. Never referenced by a component, by JS, or inside a
`[data-theme]` block.

**Tier 2 - semantics** (`src/styles/vars/semantic.css`, `@layer vars.semantic`):
role names, each `var(--<primitive>)`. This is the API everything downstream uses:

```
--bg  --fg  --muted  --line
--primary  --primary-strong  --primary-fg
--secondary  --secondary-strong  --secondary-fg
--success  --success-fg   --danger  --danger-fg   --warning  --warning-fg
--space-inline  --space-block  --space-gap
--radius-control  --radius-card  --radius-round
--font-heading  --font-body  --font-code
--motion-hero-duration  --motion-hero-ease  --motion-ui-duration  --motion-ui-ease
```

Naming follows the common Bootstrap / shadcn set.

A `[data-theme="name"] { ... }` block re-points semantics at other primitives - that
is the entire re-skin mechanism. Components and all JS consume **tier 2 only**;
never a primitive, never a raw literal.

**Deck look** (`deck.css`, repo root, `@layer deck`): the one file a deck author
edits. A commented menu of the high-value knobs (`--primary*`, `--secondary*`,
status colours, `--bg` / `--fg` / `--muted` / `--line`, `--font-*`, type scale)
plus active `--text-root-size` (shipped 32px; the primitive default stays
Reveal's 40px), `--slide-padding`, deck-wide element tweaks (list type-scale),
and the **utility classes** (`.text-primary`, `.text-muted`, `.text-center`,
`.flex-cols`, `.flex-rows`, `.list-compact`, `.box` + `.border` / `.bar`,
`.chip`, and the shared colour modifiers `.primary` / `.secondary` / `.success`
/ `.danger` / `.warning`) - a framework surface a slide may use so it never needs
its own `<style>` for common things. `@import`ed last by `src/styles/index.css`.
Highest layer, so it wins with no `!important`. `skin-builder` still writes
`[data-theme]` blocks to `semantic.css`, not here - this file is the single look
the deck ships with.

---

## 3. Cascade layer order

Declared once (`src/styles/layers.css`, and mirrored in `index.html`), low -> high:

```
@layer reveal.reset, reveal.base, reveal.theme, vars.primitive, vars.semantic, theme, components, deck;
```

Reveal's own CSS is pulled into `reveal.*` layers by `vendor/reveal-base.scss` so a
deck's `theme` / `components` / `deck` layers can override it without specificity
hacks. `deck` (the root `deck.css`) is highest. Nothing of ours is left unlayered
(unlayered = an explicit escape hatch, unused).

---

## 4. Canonical component contract

- **One definition per component.** `components/<kebab>/index.js` (repo root -
  deck-author content, not under `src/`) is the only place
  `customElements.define('deck-<kebab>', ...)` runs for it.
- The class `extends DeckElement`, imported as `@/components/deck-element.js`
  (framework machinery, `src/components/`): `attachShadow`, idempotent
  `connectedCallback`, `static styles` (CSS string in Shadow DOM), `static tag`,
  `cssVar(name)` helper.
- **Consume tier-2 semantic custom properties only** (plus Reveal's `--r-*`), and
  the shared style vocabulary in `src/components/shared-styles.js`
  (`SHARED_STYLES`, documented in `artefact-builder/reference/component-styles.md`)
  - **import it, never copy its rules** - and never a bespoke per-component
  class pile.
- A component may `import` from `@/lib/*`; a slide may not. `artefact-builder`
  builds each one from a kind recipe (`d3-chart`, `d3-circle-pack`, `svg-diagram`,
  `gsap-hero`, `alpine-interactive`); Alpine markup in a shadow root needs
  `Alpine.initTree(this.shadowRoot)` behind a ready-guard.
- Register it: one `import '../../components/<kebab>/index.js';` line **and**
  one `COMPONENTS` entry in `src/components/registry.js` (that file stays
  machinery and does not move).
- **"Does component X exist?" is answered by reading `registry.js` alone.**
- Slides place a `<deck-*>` tag and pass data via attributes / slots - never
  markup, style, or behaviour.

---

## 5. Slide portability contract

Full text in `slides/README.md`. In short, a slide file is portable iff:

1. it references shared things only via framework-guaranteed surfaces - registered
   `<deck-*>` tags, tier-2 semantic custom properties, Reveal `--r-*`, the
   `deck.css` utility classes (and `@/lib/*` only from inside a component);
2. **or** it fully inlines its artefact: scoped `<style>` + an inline
   `<script type="module">` with **zero imports**, browser-native APIs only, DOM
   lookups scoped by the slide's own `#slug` (never `document.currentScript` - it is
   `null` once Vite bundles the inline script), and any `getComputedStyle`
   custom-property read deferred to the `load` event (framework CSS is JS-injected
   in dev, so it may not be live when an inline module first runs);
3. it makes no reference to another slide's `id` and no assumption about neighbours
   (cross-slide `<a href="#/...">` links live only on the non-portable overview slide);
4. it uses semantic custom properties only - never a primitive, never a raw literal.

### Numbering

```
NN-<slug>.<html|md>      NN = zero-padded major (>= 3 digits), step 10
NN.M-<slug>.<html|md>    .M = vertical-stack minor, step 1; files sharing NN wrap in one <section> stack
```

`<slug>` (kebab) becomes the slide `id` / `data-slug`. `000-title.*` = title slide;
`010-overview.*` = jump menu (deck-specific, NOT portable). `.html` body = exactly one
`<section>` (may nest); `.md` body = raw Markdown (`--` fence = vertical sub-slide,
`Note:` line = speaker note). The plugin does not recurse into subfolders.

The step of 10 leaves gaps to insert into later without renumbering: a slide
between `020` and `030` becomes `025` (or `021` to slot right after `020`).
Only when a gap is fully used up (neighbours are consecutive integers) does it
require rebalancing that local run back to round step-10 numbers. See
`slides/README.md` for the full insertion rule.

---

## 6. Assembly

`build/vite-plugin-slides.js` runs in `transformIndexHtml` (order `'pre'`) for
`npm start`, `npm run build`, and `npm run build:deck` alike. It reads `slides/`
with `fs` (files never enter the module graph), sorts by filename, injects each at
`<!-- @slides -->`. `.md` files are inlined as `<section data-markdown><script
type="text/template">...`. Dev watcher triggers a full reload on slide add/change/
unlink; Reveal restores position from `hash: true`.

---

## 7. Terminology

Never call a styling value a **"token"** - it is a CSS custom property / CSS
variable. This binds generated code, comments, docs, and chat about styling. It
does **not** touch slide *content*: in these talks "token" legitimately means a
chunk of text, and `deck-builder` may keep that word in stub content verbatim.

---

## 8. Vertical stacks, fragments & images

Reveal.js mechanics that authoring skills rely on but don't reinvent - covered
here once so no one has to re-derive them from `js/reveal.js` source.

**Vertical stacks - two equivalent shapes:**

- Sibling files sharing a major number: `08-x.html`, `08.1-y.html`, `08.2-z.html`
  (see numbering in `slides/README.md`).
- One `.html` file, nested `<section>`s:
  ```html
  <section id="<slug>" data-slug="<slug>">
    <section><!-- first sub-slide --></section>
    <section><!-- second sub-slide --></section>
  </section>
  ```
  Prefer this shape when the sub-slides are tightly coupled (e.g. one picture
  per sub-slide under a shared question) - it keeps them in one portable file.

**Fragments (step-reveal on a single slide):** add `class="fragment"` to any
element inside a `<section>`. Variant classes change the reveal effect - `grow`
`shrink` `zoom-in` `fade-out` `semi-fade-out` `strike` `fade-up` `fade-down`
`fade-right` `fade-left` `fade-in-then-out` `current-visible`
`fade-in-then-semi-out` `highlight-red` `highlight-green` `highlight-blue`
`highlight-current-red` `highlight-current-green` `highlight-current-blue`.
`data-fragment-index="N"` (zero-based) reorders them; unindexed fragments
follow document order.

**Navigation order:** pressing down/right resolves every unrevealed fragment
on the current (sub-)slide first, one at a time, and only advances to the next
vertical/horizontal slide once none remain. A vertical stack of picture
sub-slides, each with its own fragment(s), composes directly with this - no
extra wiring needed.

**Images:** put the file under `public/` (see repo layout, section 1) and
reference it by the root-relative path Vite serves it at. Use `.r-stretch` on
an `<img>`/`<video>`/`<iframe>` to fill the remaining slide height instead of
hand-rolling a size.

---

## 9. Re-skin

Runtime: `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = '<name>'` (or `<html
data-theme="<name>">`). A skin is a `[data-theme="<name>"] { ... }` block appended
to `src/styles/vars/semantic.css` by `skin-builder`. Reveal's `--r-*` (via
`theme/deck.css`) and D3 palettes (read live via `getComputedStyle`) follow
automatically.
